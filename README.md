## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/f4NJ53rcfgrP6sBMD2jt) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Challenge: Create my CatWiki app. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue.js. Create your API. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

Using https://docs.thecatapi.com/ to complete this challenge. The client-side should not use the API directly. Everything should be handled on the server-side. For example, suggesting the breeds or getting images for the breed.

- User story: I can search for cat breeds and select a breed of my choice
- User story: I can see the most popular searched cat breeds summary on the homepage
- User story: I can see the top 10 most searched cat breeds
- User story: I can see the breed details including description, temperament, origin, life span, adaptability, affection level, child-friendly, grooming, intelligence, health issues, social needs, stranger friendly
- User story: I can see more photo of the breed
- User story: On mobile, when I select the search option, a modal for breed search should pop up
- User story (optional): I can go to an article about cats when I click read more on Why you should have a cat section
- User story (optional): I can go to the top 10 cats by clicking see more in the dashboard
- API: https://docs.thecatapi.com/
